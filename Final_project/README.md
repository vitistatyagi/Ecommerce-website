#E-Commerce Website

This project is created from php, java, CSS and HTML. This website shows a list of speakers to sell. It has
several different pages such as about, contact, etc. The connectivity has been established through php
while the data is stored on my php server. The styling has been done through CSS and the building
blocks for the webpages are created by using basic HTML. This is just a basic project for someone staring
in web developing.
